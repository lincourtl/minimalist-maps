# Minimalist Maps

**Cartes sans fronti√®res!**
----------------------------

Playing with minimalistic maps without borders as detailed in [Arthur Charpentier's blog post](http://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/20241), and featured in [The Independent](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/see-the-world-differently-with-these-minimalist-maps--W1gmV6XiBx).

It's really remarkable how suggestive of the grography and political boundaries the natural and demographic features of our world are.
